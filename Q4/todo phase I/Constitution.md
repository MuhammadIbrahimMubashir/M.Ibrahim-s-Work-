# Project Constitution

This project follows spec-driven development.

Rules:
1. Specifications must be written before implementation.
2. No unnecessary complexity.
3. Code must be readable for beginners.
4. Features are implemented phase by phase.
5. Console-based interaction only for Phase I.
